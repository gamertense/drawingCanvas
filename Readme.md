User can pick color and draw a rectangle on the canvas filled with that color.

Three tools:
1. Rectangle (fill-in color supported)
2. Pencil
3. Line

I created this version before realize [Konva.js](https://konvajs.github.io/index.html) - HTML5 2d canvas library for desktop and mobile applications.
